# higher-power-fan-club (HPFC)
## The new religion that starts fresh, from scratch.
The Religion that starts now. No scandals. No bullshit. No witches being burned to the ground.
<br>Nobody (ab)using it to claim their terroristic acts on it's behalf. (Hopefully? Due to lack of reach for now, lol)

# Technically we live by the 10 commandments.
## Maybe it's 20, maybe it's 45...
## (I honestly don't know if a majority would easily remember all 45 rules at all times...)
But technically we don't care about what they are. (Technically we do, we just don't care a whole lot, cause we lazy af.)
<br>Just - They need to make sense, speaking in a sense of keeping society clean.
<br>One example: You can have as many gods as you like, that one was complete and utter bullshit.

# Back when the 10 commandments were dropped/hot... society was a bit simpler back then
We didn't have GitHub back then. We do now.
<br>(<em>Can you imagine the world with modern technology being available in mideval times?</em>)
<br>Thank ~~GOD~~. -- Oh, wait, yeah that's the next thing --

# We do not use the term GOD. That term is tabu.
## been abused too often already.
Also, unfortunately many people have disobeyed the important rule of not making an image of GOD.
<br>The Christian God - when this sin is committed - is often depicted male, the truth is this is a sad fact and people showing images of "god" --
<br>and claiming to BELIEVE in Christianity can suck my... well, you get it.

## The soul out there, if it even has a soul... (Like... [Dr.] Who the fuck knows?)
# We call it THE HIGHER POWER
## That's why this is the HPFC: The Higher Power Fan-Club
There's a nice [pop song by Coldplay](https://youtu.be/3lfnR7OhZY8)... that just fits ALL TO WELL here.
<br><em>Cue screaming Swifties.</em>
<br>Oh yeah... "We don't idolize pop culture figures." would be another great mantra to live by.
<br>But no hate, if you need to idolize certain personalities to <strong>live your life to the fullest.</strong>
<br>Just try and keep the idolizing to a sane level, o.k.? Is that too much to ask? I should think not.

# You're allowed to be mad at the HIGHER POWER.
## In public or anywhere you like or feel comfortable with.
Shame is a negative feeling you can surpress if you try hard enough.
<br>In a store, if the prices feel like they jumped, go crazy.
<br>Tell the world your feelings. Where it makes sense. Or where it doesn't, if it feels right.

# Don't put too much value into the buildings
## (where the prayers are held/society meets... and other things happen too? Or so I heard.)
## Put more value in the conversations you have with the Higher Power.</strong>
If a protestant Christian church is nearby, try that one (?*)
<br>(or don't if you feel that's a better choice for you, personally)

\* feels like it might be the fewest of evils out there;
<br>Although... looking too far into the past of any church is probably a bad idea, generally;
<br><strong>Not intended as an endorsement of any kind of church here.</strong>
