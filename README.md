## Du bist eine Deutsche Kartoffel? - [Hier entlang!](LIESMICH.md)

# higher-power-fan-club (HPFC)
## The new religion that starts fresh, from scratch.
The Religion that starts now. No scandals. No bullshit. No witches being burned to the ground.
<br>Nobody (ab)using it to claim their terroristic acts on it's behalf. (Hopefully? Due to lack of reach for now, lol)
<br><strong>Very loosely</strong> based on believes of the protestant Christian church.

# Technically we live by the 10 commandments.
## Maybe it's 20, maybe it's 45...
## (I honestly don't know if a majority would easily remember all 45 rules at all times...)
But technically we don't care about what they are. (Technically we do, we just don't care a whole lot, cause we lazy af.)
<br>Just - They need to make sense, speaking in a sense of keeping society clean.
<br>One example: You can have as many gods as you like, that one was complete and utter bullshit.

# Back when the 10 commandments were dropped/hot...<br>society was a bit simpler back then
We didn't have GitHub back then. We do now.
<br>(<em>Can you imagine the world with modern technology being available in mideval times?</em>)
<br>Thank ~~GOD~~. -- Oh, wait, yeah that's the next thing --

# We do not use the term GOD. That term is tabu.
## been abused too often already.
Also, unfortunately many people have disobeyed the important rule of not making an image of GOD.
<br>The Christian God - when this sin is committed - is often depicted male, the truth is this is a sad fact and people showing images of "god" --
<br>and claiming to BELIEVE in Christianity can suck my... well, you get it.

## The soul out there, if it even has a soul... (Like... [Dr.] Who the fuck knows?)
# We call it THE HIGHER POWER
## That's why this is the HPFC: The Higher Power Fan-Club
There's a nice [pop song by Coldplay](https://youtu.be/3lfnR7OhZY8)... that just fits ALL TO WELL here.
<br><em>Cue screaming Swifties.</em>
<br>Oh yeah... "We don't idolize pop culture figures." would be another great mantra to live by.
<br>But no hate, if you need to idolize certain personalities to <strong>live your life to the fullest.</strong>
<br>Just try and keep the idolizing to a sane level, o.k.? Is that too much to ask? I should think not.

# You're allowed to be mad at the HIGHER POWER.
## In public or anywhere you like or feel comfortable with.
Shame is a negative feeling you can surpress if you try hard enough.
<br>In a store, if the prices feel like they jumped, go crazy.
<br>Tell the world your feelings. Where it makes sense. Or where it doesn't, if it feels right.

# Don't put too much value into the buildings
## (where the prayers are held/society meets... and other things happen too? Or so I heard.)
## Put more value in the conversations you have with the Higher Power.</strong>
If a protestant Christian church is nearby, try that one (?*)
<br>(or don't if you feel that's a better choice for you, personally)

I personally feel like it might be the fewest of evils out there;
<br>Although... looking too far into the past of any church is probably a bad idea, generally;
<br><strong>Not intended as an endorsement of any kind of church here.</strong>

# Fuck the official rules/laws wherever it makes any sense whatsoever
# Take responsibility  for your actions* ...<br>ONLY if it makes sense in the moment.
Or if you are asked/forced to by law enforcement agencies of where you reside or where you visit.
<br>\* What does it mean? Nobody really knows. (Think back and realize you fucked up or got caught f√∫cking it up - end of story.)
## Be risk-aware if you fuck the rules. (Don't be stupid.)
## Yeah, they're there for a reason...<br>but the weak are being exploited and the mighty are getting richer by the second.

# The Higher Power hates the imbalance in the (in)justice.
## The Higher Power is well-aware that you aren't expected to fix the problem by yourself.

Just don't be sheeple. OK?
<br>Don't vote for Trump, he's very evil when it comes to faking a love for religion.
<br>(Doing a very bad job of faking it believably)

# OPINION: Religion so very much HAS A PLACE in politics
## Don't vote for Kamala if you don't think she has what it takes.
## Where was she after the televised debate?!
### Should've been working on convincing him to drop out the day after.
## But she was in denial, like the rest of the relevant Democrats.
### (Although, loads of critisism started pouring in after additional gaffes on Biden's behalf.)
## The VIP funds were only pulled as a last measure.
A fucking act of ~~desperacy~~ desperation (if we wanna stay modern with the language, and... fuck, we do!).

## You're voting between a racist orange man who doesn't care too much about facts
## (which is generally not a good thing if you're running for head of the union)
## and someone who clearly lacks leadership skills. - OPINION.

# OPINION: DON'T VOTE!!
## IN THIS DEVISIVE POLITICAL SHIT SHOW.

# However, if for whatever fucked up reason you do still wanna vote...
## it will be entirely up to you which one of the two you pick.
## I am not gonna tell you which "demon" you should elect...
I guess... whatever gets your political penis erect.
<br>(or gives your political vagina a sensational feeling)
