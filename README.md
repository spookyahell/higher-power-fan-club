## The new religion that starts fresh, from scratch.
The Religion that starts now. No scandals. No bullshit. No witches being burned to the ground.
<br>Nobody (ab)using it to claim their terroristic acts on it's behalf. (Hopefully? Due to lack of reach for now, lol)

# Technically we live by the 10 commandments.
But technically we don't care about what they are. (Technically we do, we just don't care a whole lot, cause we lazy af.)
<br>You can have as many gods as you like, that one was complete and utter bullshit.
<br>Just - They need to make sense, speaking in a sense of keeping society clean.

# Back when the 10 commandments were dropped/hot... society was a bit simpler back then
We didn't have GitHub back then. We do now.
<br>Thank ~~GOD~~. -- Oh, wait, yeah that's the next thing --

# We do not use the term GOD. That term is tabu.
## been abused too often already.
Also, unfortunately many people have disobeyed the important rule of not making an image of GOD.
<br>God is often depicted male, the truth is this is a sad fact and people showing images of "god" --

## The soul out there, if it even has a soul, like who the fuck knows..
# We call it THE HIGHER POWER
There's a nice [pop song by Coldplay](https://youtu.be/3lfnR7OhZY8)... that just fits ALL TO WELL here.
<br><em>Cue screaming Swifties.</em>
<br>Oh yeah... "We don't idolize pop culture figures." would be another great mantra to live by.
<br>But no hate, if you need to idolize certain personalities to <strong>live your life to the fullest.</strong>
<br>Just try and keep the idolizing to a sane level, o.k.? Is that too much to ask? I should think not.
